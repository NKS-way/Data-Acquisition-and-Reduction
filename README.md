# Data-Acquisition-and-Reduction
Data Acquisition is the process of acquiring data from astronomical telescopes(Hubble Space Telescope in this case), to perform operations on it for research purposes. 
Raw data often requires cleaning to remove instrumental noise, cosmic ray hits, or other artifacts. This cleaning is Data Reduction.
